# Lab: Web Scraping
## Overview
My Simple approach to building web scraper using Beautiful Soup library in Python

## Feature Tasks and Requirements
- Scrape a Wikipedia page and record which passages need citations.
- Your web scraper should report the number of citations needed. 
- Your web scraper should identify those cases AND include the relevant passage. 

## Implementation Notes
- `get_citations_needed_count(link)` takes in a url and returns an integer.
- `get_citations_needed_report(link)` takes in a url and returns a string the string should be formatted with each citation needed on own line, in order found.

I watched a bunch of youtube videos from channels like `Data Science Dojo`, `Hitesh Choudhary` and made these scripts.
